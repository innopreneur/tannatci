Install

`$ npm install -g truffle`
Quick Usage
For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

$ truffle init
From there, you can run truffle compile, truffle migrate and truffle test to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

Truffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands above. If you'd like to configure a more advanced development environment we recommend you install the blockchain server separately by running npm install -g ganache-cli at the command line.
