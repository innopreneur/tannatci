### This project is developed as part of ETHBerlin Hackathon.

## Development

The app is a single page React app, created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start development, clone this repo, install all dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:innoprenuer/tannatci.git
cd tannatci/

docker-compose up

npm i
npm start
```

For development, the `tannatci-be/`, `tannatci-fe/` and `tannatci-gannache/` directories have their own docker containers, which are configured via the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The client server is spun up at `localhost:3050` and it proxies internally to the server using the linked name as `server:8080`.

The local directories are mounted into the containers, so changes will reflect immediately. However, changes to package.json will likely need to a rebuild: `docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up`.

### Notes

#### Installing npm dependencies

All changes to `node_modules` should happen _inside_ the containers. Install any new dependencies by inside the container. You can do this via `docker-compose run`, but it‚Äôs easier to just upadte a running container and avoid having to rebuild everything:

```
docker-compose exec client
```

Then inside:

```
npm install --save <new_dependency>
```

## Production

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

For production, this uses the Dockerfile at the root of the repo. It creates a static build of the client React app and runs Express inside server, which handles both the API and serving of React files.

As a result, different code is executing to serve the React files, but all of the API calls should remain the same. The difference between development and production isn‚Äôt ideal, but it does offer the simplicity of having the entire app run in one server on one machine.
